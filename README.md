```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bastien-pruvost/react-training-projects.git

2. Go to the project directory:

```bash
  cd react-training-projects
```

3. Go to a specifif project:

```bash
  cd 13-useContext
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
  pnpm install
  # or
  yarn install
  # or
  npm install
```

4. Run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



## Build a project

To build a project for production usage, run the following command:
